## Change styles

You can find several folders inside `src/styles/semantic/themes/default`. Each folder has a group of *.variables* and *.overrides* files. Both of them are _LESS_ code.

In *.variables* files, you can modify different parameters and in *.overrides* you can add code to override final selector.

## Development

Run `npm install` first time and after each pull

Run `ng serve`

## Production

Run `npm install && npm run build-prod && npm start`
